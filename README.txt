This game was written in Python 1.13.5.

No AI was used in the making of this game.

P.S Press Q and E together at the "Pygame Powered" logo for debug mode (works best with source code)

Oh, by the way, if you're reading this from the game,
use arrows to scroll.

=== Porting to Linux ===

Yeah I've already tried this on Linux Mint but cx_Freeze won't include Pygame in the build.
So it builds fine but Pygame is missing.
