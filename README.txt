This game was written in Python 1.13.5.

No AI was used in the making of this game.

P.S Press Q and E together at the "Pygame Powered" logo for debug mode (works best with source code)

Oh, by the way, if you're reading this from the game,
use arrows to scroll.

=== Update for Version a0.6.2 ===

I apologise for not publishing any updates for the last two months. I've been trying to learn more Pygame to make the game run smoother eventually.
I've also been trying to learn how to use tools like Git for when I make the game open-source.
The next update I'm going to try to get a lot more done and optimise the code.

=== Porting to Linux ===

Yeah I've already tried this on Linux Mint but cx_Freeze won't include Pygame in the build.
So it builds fine but Pygame is missing.
